/** 
 * This class manages penalties during exam execution.
 * Also it takes care about state of @class TexamView and @class TprogressWidget widgets
 * @p m_penalStep is determines how many 'normal' questions is asked between penalties
 * When it is 0 - penalty is asked every time.
 * @p m_penalCount counts questions and is increased by @p nextQuestion()
 * @p m_blackQuestNr keeps number of question in a black list or it is -1 when 'normal' question.
 * @p m_blackNumber the same as above but for melodies questions
 * 
 * @p nextQuestion() is invoked fromTexam::askQuestion() to increase counter
 * then @p ask() prepares the penalty if its time was come.
 * @p checkAnswer() manages @p m_exam state (summarize the answer) and updates counters of the widgets 
 * and adds penalties if necessary. 
 * Due to melody questions can be continued (new attempts), this method can't determine penalties in this moment.
 * @p setMelodyPenalties() has to be called when user decided that question is answered/finished.
 * This method is invoked from @class TexamExacutor when new question is created (@p askQUestion() there)
 * @p setBlackQuestion() is called from Texam::repeatQuestion() 
 * to set @p m_blackQuestNr to the last question in the black list and when answer on it is correct
 * this repeated question is removed from the list.
 * @p checkAnswer() and @p setMelodyPenalties() perform certificate check 
 * and when appropriate question number was done @p certificate() signal is emitted.
