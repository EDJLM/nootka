============================================================================
================              TODO LIST               ======================
============================================================================


====== BUGS AND ISSUES ===============================================
MAJOR:
- when new staff is automatically added selected note is wrong
- fix accidental animations - they jump when melody is set as a question
- also switching clefs with set some key sucks
- do not continue answering with melody that was fully or too much corrected
- try to avoid many resizeEvent-s of TmultiScore during window size change
- exercise file still can be corrupted
- avoid analyzing of empty exercise
- lock right button and space bar during correction
- analyzer crash when tip is displayed and CTRL+e is pressed

- certificates has to be adjusted to melodies
- canvas has to recognize when widgets are hidden and doesn't start correcting animations 


MINOR:
- changing tool bar auto-hiding causes sometimes locked melody menu
- clicked link of tip locks next click - probably due to grabbed focus - however click outside tip unlocks it
- when playable exam/exercise doesn't require octave audio - input ambitus has to be capable to detect wider range of sounds
- selecting read only notes (right and double click) is unused - it is good - but clean a code
- auto hidden tool bar remains big after decreased window size
- on level load (i.e. Master) intonation combo reminds disabled even if q/a allowing it
- There is unused class TnotePixmap only with default clef - use it or delete
- vertical name layout is probably unused - clear it then
- changing to/from grand staff overrides TscoreNote ambitus - there is no problem as long as ambitus is unused
- revert to native style under MacOs when Qt5


==== NEW FEATURES ================================================================
- new way of adding notes just after the last one was clicked
- proxy corner widgets should be animated
- tidy key signature in note pixmap (width depends on accidentals number)
- text only tool bar
- add blinking of settings icon(action) instead of expert check boxes in old versions
- move status label out as a separate class and implement animations there (can be used in settings windows as well) 
- make exam summary pretty
- Tsound has to have a timer to determine rhythmical value of detected note (or a rest)
  then emitting signal should contain Tchunk instead Tnote
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			
TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required

===============================================================
========== TRANSLATIONS =======================================
===============================================================
 - TtoolBar has many entries translated already - just confirm them
 - Tpage_3 context was moved and description fixed but source text remained the same - just confirm
 - 'You are exercising on level' and 'Exam started on level' moved to Tcanvas from executor - just confirm
 
 
===============================================================     
============== Packaging (cpack) =============================
===============================================================
- update Qt5 dependencies for deb package 
- remember about libPrintSupport
