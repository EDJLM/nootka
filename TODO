============================================================================
================              TODO LIST               ======================
============================================================================
Translations:
 - remove <br> from some status strings (rangesettings.cpp, accidsettings.cpp)

ANDROID:
- crash when audio out was disables and enabled again in settings (audio in probably also)
- add 'smallest font size' to Tmtr ???
- solve issue with restart for settings reset
- keep scroll bar of score always off - it appears when switching single/multi
- Help QTextBrowser has QScroller but it works only with two-touch move, but TlevelPreview works good
- HOME button would be switching available menus
- handle BACK button to destroy visible menu and/or prevent to close exam
- alternate enharmonical names color is white by default in settings (when single note is unlocked)
  its change is not approved to score
- TexamExecutor has many, many un-wrapped strings, many ""

- remove tanimedtextitem.cpp - probably unused

To consideration:
- additional settings options:
    - disable screen locking (TRUE by default)
    - full screen mode (TRUE by default)
    - home button actions

============================================================================
Issues of stable 1.2.2:
- fix white lines off staff in the main icon
============================================================================

- Move context of Ttune translations from QObject to some more suitable name
- clean tartini unused code

MINOR:
- when instrument in new exercise changes: 
      if it is started from creator - there is highlight of message 
      but when started from 'start' menu - there is not
- try to avoid many resizeEvent-s of TmultiScore during window size change


- changing tool bar auto-hiding causes sometimes locked melody menu
- auto hidden tool bar remains big after decreased window size


- changing to/from grand staff overrides TscoreNote ambitus - there is no problem as long as ambitus is unused
- selecting read only notes (right and double click) is unused - it is good - but clean a code
- revert to native style under MacOs when Qt5

==== SMALL NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS =============================================================
- add minimal zoom value depends on screen resolution
- average effectiveness line in chart
- make exam summary pretty
- certificates would have some additional data about melodies
- bring back isVoice() audio param - average pitch of all chunks or min duration will depend on it
- clear code for guitar body images

- divide TexamExecutor class !!!!!
- rhythms in score
- in occasion of implementing rhythms, 
      instead of signaling from TscoreNote to TscoreStaff call some methods of TscoreStaff directly from TscoreNote
- dialog to configure generated melody and its rhythms
- rhythms in level and exercise/exam
- Tsound has to have a timer to determine rhythmical value of detected note (or a rest)
     then emitting signal should contain Tchunk instead Tnote
- unlock and improve saving melodies to musicXML and opening/importing melodies from XML
  (MUSIC XML is not fully standard compatible (check what MuseScore complains))
  - stop sniffer when melody dialogues are opening
- Class that manages recent exams menu list and has colored item 'recent opened exams',
    use recent exams list for analyzer the same as start exam dialog has (common class or method)
- add extra marks over score when it is in record mode or melody is playing
- managing melodies in levels, adding set of melodies to the level
- settings for keyboard shortcuts
- sophisticated and configurable algorithm to generate random melodies
- option for changing melody key (transposition) - in a level key range as well
- intervals: creating melody with set of available intervals only
- intervals: questions related to them in exam/exercises
- recognizing melodies from *.ogg and *.wav files
- support for (octavation marks) - octave drop/rise (8-va, 15-va)
- add piano keyboard as an option instead of a guitar
- preview of questions in Level Creator (list, on the guitar, in the score)
- comparing exams (charts)
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- add blinking of settings icon(action) instead of expert check boxes in old versions (???)
- proxy corner widgets may be animated (???)
- add sound during wizard and About dialog (???)
- options for adjusting pitch detection range to  1.score, 2. instrument scale (???)
- enable/disable animations option
- text only tool bar
- migrate on preferring 48000 sample rate (ogg files and audio methods)
- move status label out as a separate class and implement animations there (can be used in settings windows as well) 

ANDROID:
- unlock left-handed guitar then implement frets zoom to respect transforms

Tnote
  - change class name to Tpitch (???)
	- overload + and - operators to raise/drop a note

TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required 


TO CONSIDER:
  - In wizard: option for single note mode for very beginners
  - simplify license text - take translations from Wine project
