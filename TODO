============================================================================
================              TODO LIST               ======================
============================================================================


====== BUGS AND ISSUES ===============================================
MAJOR:
- when new staff is automatically added selected note is wrong
- changing tool bar auto-hiding causes sometimes locked melody menu
- fix accidental animations - they jump when melody is set as a question
- selecting read only notes (right and double click) is unused - it is good - but clean a code
- do not continue answering with melody that was fully or too much corrected

- certificates has to be adjusted to melodies

Tcanvas
- canvas has to recognize when widgets are hidden and doesn't start correct animations 

Scaling issues:
- auto hidden tool bar remains big after decreased window size

- There is unused class TnotePixmap only with default clef - use it or delete
- vertical name layout is probably unused - clear it then

- changing to/from grand staff overrides TscoreNote ambitus - there is no problem as long as ambitus is unused

MINOR:

- move what_next/question tips to the right over guitar in single note mode

- think to disable pitch view during melodies correction - it is just stopped now

- restart ASIO when it is changed by user or just display info to restart Nootka

Charts:
	- when Tchart creator calculates when set scene rectangle increase scene width with its -x() position
	- points (notes) shadow changes with zoom - fix it
	- staff line disappears sometimes (when zoom is big)
	- use of realW() & realH() of TgraphicsTip
	- add preview of long (more than 15 notes) melodies

- revert to native style under MacOs when Qt5

Tnote
	- overload + and - operators to raise/drop a note
	- make appropriate methods const


==== NEW FEATURES ================================================================
- proxy corner widgets should be animated (if they remain live)
- marge name settings with score settings
- tidy key signature in note pixmap (width depends on accidentals number)
- text only tool bar
- allow scaling a multiple staves score in disabled state
- add blinking of settings icon(action) instead of expert check boxes in old versions
- enable/disable animations option
- make exam summary pretty
- there has to be some help with key shortcuts
- Tsound has to have a timer to determine rhythmical value of detected note (or a rest)
  then emitting signal should contain Tchunk instead Tnote
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			
TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required

===============================================================
========== TRANSLATIONS =======================================
===============================================================
 - TtoolBar has many entries translated already - just confirm them
 - Tpage_3 context was moved and description fixed but source text remained the same - just confirm
 - 'You are exercising on level' and 'Exam started on level' moved to Tcanvas from executor - just confirm
 
 
===============================================================     
============== Packaging (cpack) =============================
===============================================================
- update Qt5 dependencies for deb package 
- remember about libPrintSupport
