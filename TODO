----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Score controlling buttons:
	- tempo menu
	- octave drop/rise (8-va, 15-va)
	- rhythms (steams and rests)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tnote
			- overload + and - operators to raise/drop a note
			
TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - when question is played melody to put in a score and there are multiple keys and key is given manually:
		do not show what key but user has to guess it
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required
