================              TODO LIST               ======================
============================================================================

====== BUGS AND ISSUES ===============================================
MAJOR:
- crash on terminate in Oxygen due to animation on status label
- qt_base translations are not loaded properly
- add Qt::DirectConnection flag to some signal-slot connections (pitch detection related especially)

PITCH DETECTION IMPROVEMENTS
- put message to user about his responsibility to sound quality
- pull up noise filter settings of Tartini and make it off by default
- add configurable option of split note by volume change and threshold
- take pitch of a note as a close value to 'perfect pitch' - rounded value
TO consider 
- automate detection of best minimal volume and volume split threshold

MINOR:
- replace all font-size: 20px with <big>
- MUSIC XML is not fully standard compatible (check what MuseScore complains)
- when Nootka starts in single mode proxy corner appears
- when tool bar is auto hide record melody icon is not set - some mark could be there
- lock right button and space bar during correction
- try to avoid many resizeEvent-s of TmultiScore during window size change
- changing tool bar auto-hiding causes sometimes locked melody menu
- clicked link of tip locks next click - probably due to grabbed focus - however click outside tip unlocks it
- when exercise is finished and analysis dialog was opened message text remains
- add minimal zoom value depends on screen resolution
- add gap item between accidentals (x # and b bb) on left control to avoid blinking
- let clef menu works as such as note name pop up - extract common class with under-laying tip 
- creator "use different names" switch of Questions remains enabled for melodies where names are unused
- when playable exam/exercise doesn't require octave audio - input ambitus has to be capable to detect wider range of sounds
- selecting read only notes (right and double click) is unused - it is good - but clean a code
- auto hidden tool bar remains big after decreased window size
- on level load (i.e. Master) intonation combo reminds disabled even if q/a allowing it
- There is unused class TnotePixmap only with default clef - use it or delete
- changing to/from grand staff overrides TscoreNote ambitus - there is no problem as long as ambitus is unused
- add info about font and icons to About dialog
- revert to native style under MacOs when Qt5

TO CONSIDER:
- In wizard: option for single note mode for very beginners
- In audio in settings: option for average pitch of whole note (aka voice/guitar mode)
- simplify license text - take translations from Wine project

==== SMALL NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS =============================================================
- average effectiveness line in chart
- proxy corner widgets may be animated
- tidy key signature in note pixmap (width depends on accidentals number)
- text only tool bar
- shrink a bit score and note name in single mode
- Class that manages recent exams menu list and has colored item 'recent opened exams',
    use recent exams list for analyzer the same as start exam dialog has (common class or method)
- add blinking of settings icon(action) instead of expert check boxes in old versions
- move status label out as a separate class and implement animations there (can be used in settings windows as well) 
- make exam summary pretty
- certificates would have some additional data about melodies
- Tsound has to have a timer to determine rhythmical value of detected note (or a rest)
  then emitting signal should contain Tchunk instead Tnote
TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required 
 
===============================================================     
============== Packaging (cpack) =============================
===============================================================
- update Qt5 dependencies for deb package
