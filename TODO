============================================================================
================              TODO LIST               ======================
============================================================================

====== BUGS AND ISSUES ===============================================
MAJOR:
- midi output disables volume viewer
- crash on terminate in Oxygen due to animation on status label
- restore defaults for newer options!s

MINOR:
- when instrument in new exercise changes: 
      if it is started from creator - there is highlight of message 
      but when started from 'start' menu - there is not
- replace all font-szie: 20px with <big>
- when exercise is finished and analysis dialog was opened message text remains
- stop sniffer when melody dialogues are opening
- changing tool bar auto-hiding causes sometimes locked melody menu
- auto hidden tool bar remains big after decreased window size

- There is unused class TnotePixmap only with default clef - use it or delete
- changing to/from grand staff overrides TscoreNote ambitus - there is no problem as long as ambitus is unused
- selecting read only notes (right and double click) is unused - it is good - but clean a code
- revert to native style under MacOs when Qt5

TRANSLATIONS
 - Tab names in input settings have only removed numbers - texts are the same


==== SMALL NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS =============================================================
- try to avoid many resizeEvent-s of TmultiScore during window size change
- add minimal zoom value depends on screen resolution
- average effectiveness line in chart
- make exam summary pretty
- certificates would have some additional data about melodies

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

- rhythms in score
- dialog to configure generated melody and its rhythms
- rhythms in level and exercise/exam
- Tsound has to have a timer to determine rhythmical value of detected note (or a rest)
     then emitting signal should contain Tchunk instead Tnote
- unlock and improve saving melodies to musicXML and opening/importing melodies from XML
  (MUSIC XML is not fully standard compatible (check what MuseScore complains))
- Class that manages recent exams menu list and has colored item 'recent opened exams',
    use recent exams list for analyzer the same as start exam dialog has (common class or method)
- add extra marks over score when it is in record mode or melody is playing
- managing melodies in levels, adding set of melodies to the level
- settings for keyboard shortcuts
- sophisticated and configurable algorithm to generate random melodies
- option for changing melody key (transposition) - in a level key range as well
- intervals: creating melody with set of available intervals only
- intervals: questions related to them in exam/exercises
- recognizing melodies from *.ogg and *.wav files
- support for (octavation marks) - octave drop/rise (8-va, 15-va)
- add piano keyboard as an option instead of a guitar
- preview of questions in Level Creator (list, on the guitar, in the score)
- comparing exams (charts)
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- add blinking of settings icon(action) instead of expert check boxes in old versions (???)
- proxy corner widgets may be animated (???)
- add sound during wizard and About dialog (???)
- options for adjusting pitch detection range to  1.score, 2. instrument scale (???)
- enable/disable animations option
- text only tool bar
- migrate on preferring 48000 sample rate (ogg files and audio methods)
- move status label out as a separate class and implement animations there (can be used in settings windows as well) 



Tnote
  - change class name to Tpitch (???)
	- overload + and - operators to raise/drop a note
	- make appropriate methods const

TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required 


TO CONSIDER:
  - In wizard: option for single note mode for very beginners
  - simplify license text - take translations from Wine project
