============================================================================
================              TODO LIST               ======================
============================================================================

TRANSLATION CONTEXT CHANGES
  TpitchView -> PitchView
  TvolumeView -> VolumeBar
  TaboutNootka -> AuthorsPage
  TscoreSettings -> ScorePage, KeySufixEdit,  (rearrange ScorePage)
  TradioClef - Tclef (rearrange Tclef)
  TguitarSettings - InstrumentPage
  TscoreActions & TmelMan - MainScore
  TtoolBar - MainWindow
  accidssettings -> AccidsPage (but remove line breaks from descriptions)
  rangeSettings -> RangePage as well (be careful with TlevelPreview texts there)
  AudioInSettings -> SoundPage

  NameStyleSelector - text "Naming style of note. The main difference is the 7th note.<br>Is it B and B flat, or H and B?" has to go into ScorePage or its sub-page with name settings
  TnoteNameSettings - ScorePage or its sub-page
  TlevelCreatorDlg -> LevelCreator
  TsupportNootka -> SupportPage
  AdioInSettings ??? copy "semitone(s)" text to Transposition context but remove %n

============================================================================

small glitches:
 - sometimes setting a note doesn't scale tie - probably due to note width is not refreshed

============================================================================
  Do we need Tmtr?? Make order with this!

============================================================================
ANDROID:
    - quick icons:
        - disable sniffing/note by note when audio input is off
        - hide 'clear score' one when undesired (single mode, exam with playing):
          innerWidget->flyActions()->append(bar->scoreDeleteAll()); // TODO: idea is brilliant but needs more efforts

============================================================================
- TexamExecutor has many, many un-wrapped strings, many ""
- Use int and enumerations between plugins and main window instead of text messages (level plugin to do)

To consideration:
- additional settings options:
    - disable screen locking (TRUE by default)
    - full screen mode (TRUE by default)
    - home button actions


- NotaData of Tartini might be cleaned

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

==== SMALL NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS =============================================================
- triplets and editable ties
- add minimal zoom value depends on screen resolution
- average effectiveness line in chart
- make exam summary pretty
- certificates would have some additional data about melodies
- bring back isVoice() audio param - average pitch of all chunks or min duration will depend on it

- divide TexamExecutor class !!!!!

- dialog to configure generated melody and its rhythms
- rhythms in level and exercise/exam
- Tsound has to have a timer to determine rhythmical value of detected note (or a rest)
     then emitting signal should contain Tchunk instead Tnote
  - stop sniffer when melody dialogues are opening
- Class that manages recent exams menu list and has colored item 'recent opened exams',
    use recent exams list for analyzer the same as start exam dialog has (common class or method)
- managing melodies in levels, adding set of melodies to the level
- settings for keyboard shortcuts
- sophisticated and configurable algorithm to generate random melodies
- option for changing melody key (transposition) - in a level key range as well
- intervals: creating melody with set of available intervals only
- intervals: questions related to them in exam/exercises
- recognizing melodies from *.ogg and *.wav files
- support for (octavation marks) - octave drop/rise (8-va, 15-va)
- preview of questions in Level Creator (list, on the guitar, in the score)
- comparing exams (charts)
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- add sound during wizard and About dialog (???)
- options for adjusting pitch detection range to  1.score, 2. instrument scale (???)
- text only tool bar
- migrate on preferring 48000 sample rate (ogg files and audio methods)
- move status label out as a separate class and implement animations there (can be used in settings windows as well) 

- unlock left-handed guitar then implement frets zoom to respect transforms


TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required 


TO CONSIDER:
  - In wizard: option for single note mode for very beginners
