TODO List


- after deleting clef menu work note lines doesn't change current TscoreNote parent - use moveWorkNote() for it
- (guitar) check question mark scaling for left-handed (TODO)
- merge nootka-one changes with this branch
- scordature has improper boundingRect()
- TscoreView and TscoreItem have to have Android compile scopes
- status tips are not filtered in main window event() so stable tip doesn't work

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Score controlling buttons:
	- tempo menu
	- octave drop/rise (8-va, 15-va)
	- rhythms (steams and rests)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tnote
			- overload + and - operators to raise/drop a note
			
TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - when question is played melody to put in a score and there are multiple keys and key is given manually:
		do not show what key but user has to guess it
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required
     
cpack 
- add man page for new executable files
- update Qt5 dependencies for deb package 
- copy qtbase_xx.qm files to lang folder
- remember about libPrintSupport
