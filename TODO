============================================================================
================              TODO LIST               ======================
============================================================================
ISSUES of the new score (with rhythms)
- TscoreMeasure has many TODOs - clear them
- eight notes meter 3/8, 5/8 - when set, rhythm pane still shows quarter as default - it should be a eight note
============================================================================
- TqaUnit::setMistake(Etype mis) -  use casting of mistake type enum to int instead of switch/case every type
- TexamExecutor has many, many un-wrapped strings, many ""
- Use int and enumerations between plugins and main window instead of text messages - especially updater


============================================================================
Translations:
 - remove <br> from some status strings (rangesettings.cpp, accidsettings.cpp)
 - Ttune - new context moved from QObject
 - move translations from level definitions into Tlevel context (some are there already)

 
============================================================================
ANDROID:
    - quick icons:
        - disable sniffing/note by note when audio input is off
        - hide 'clear score' one when undesired (single mode, exam with playing):
          innerWidget->flyActions()->append(bar->scoreDeleteAll()); // TODO: idea is brilliant but needs more efforts

- when no guitar preview - staff lines are too big

- duration of animation of note correction was decreased to 200ms to work properly under Android,
  but it would be better to signal when it is finished and perform some routines in main score after that
============================================================================

To consideration:
- additional settings options:
    - disable screen locking (TRUE by default)
    - full screen mode (TRUE by default)
    - home button actions

Test scaling of alpha under Windows

- NoteData of Tartini might be cleaned

MINOR:
- when instrument in new exercise changes: 
      if it is started from creator - there is highlight of message 
      but when started from 'start' menu - there is not
- try to avoid many resizeEvent-s of TmultiScore during window size change


- changing tool bar auto-hiding causes sometimes locked melody menu
- auto hidden tool bar remains big after decreased window size


- changing to/from grand staff overrides TscoreNote ambitus - there is no problem as long as ambitus is unused
- selecting read only notes (right and double click) is unused - it is good - but clean a code

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

==== SMALL NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS =============================================================
- average effectiveness line in chart
- make exam summary pretty
- certificates would have some additional data about melodies
- bring back isVoice() audio param - average pitch of all chunks or min duration will depend on it
- clear code for guitar body images

- divide TexamExecutor class !!!!!
- rhythms in score
- dialog to configure generated melody and its rhythms
- rhythms in level and exercise/exam
- Tsound has to have a timer to determine rhythmical value of detected note (or a rest)
     then emitting signal should contain Tchunk instead Tnote
- unlock and improve saving melodies to musicXML and opening/importing melodies from XML
  (MUSIC XML is not fully standard compatible (check what MuseScore complains))
  - stop sniffer when melody dialogues are opening
- Class that manages recent exams menu list and has colored item 'recent opened exams',
    use recent exams list for analyzer the same as start exam dialog has (common class or method)
- add extra marks over score when it is in record mode or melody is playing
- managing melodies in levels, adding set of melodies to the level
- settings for keyboard shortcuts
- sophisticated and configurable algorithm to generate random melodies
- option for changing melody key (transposition) - in a level key range as well
- intervals: creating melody with set of available intervals only
- intervals: questions related to them in exam/exercises
- recognizing melodies from *.ogg and *.wav files
- support for (octavation marks) - octave drop/rise (8-va, 15-va)
- add piano keyboard as an option instead of a guitar
- preview of questions in Level Creator (list, on the guitar, in the score)
- comparing exams (charts)
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- add blinking of settings icon(action) instead of expert check boxes in old versions (???)
- proxy corner widgets may be animated (???)
- add sound during wizard and About dialog (???)
- options for adjusting pitch detection range to  1.score, 2. instrument scale (???)
- enable/disable animations option
- text only tool bar
- migrate on preferring 48000 sample rate (ogg files and audio methods)
- move status label out as a separate class and implement animations there (can be used in settings windows as well) 

ANDROID:
- unlock left-handed guitar then implement frets zoom to respect transforms

Tnote
	- overload + and - operators to raise/drop a note

TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required 


TO CONSIDER:
  - In wizard: option for single note mode for very beginners
  - simplify license text at first look
