============================================================================
================              TODO LIST               ======================
============================================================================


====== BUGS AND ISSUES ===============================================
MAJOR:
- fix when 'enter note' text and edit lines appears in empty note on the score

MINOR:
- when Nootka starts in single mode proxy corner appears
- when tool bar is auto hide record melody icon is not set - some mark could be there
- lock right button and space bar during correction
- updater and analyzer windows have missing window title (and icon)
- try to avoid many resizeEvent-s of TmultiScore during window size change
- changing tool bar auto-hiding causes sometimes locked melody menu
- clicked link of tip locks next click - probably due to grabbed focus - however click outside tip unlocks it
- when exercise is finished and analysis dialog was opened message text remains
- clef in empty level preview table is out of borders (TlevelPreview)
- add minimal zoom value depends on screen resolution
- it would be better when melody/score pop up menus and clef menu parent will be main window (like TnoteName)
- let clef menu works as such as note name pop up - extract common class with under-laying tip 
- creator "use different names" switch of Questions remains enabled for melodies where names are unused
- when playable exam/exercise doesn't require octave audio - input ambitus has to be capable to detect wider range of sounds
- selecting read only notes (right and double click) is unused - it is good - but clean a code
- auto hidden tool bar remains big after decreased window size
- on level load (i.e. Master) intonation combo reminds disabled even if q/a allowing it
- There is unused class TnotePixmap only with default clef - use it or delete
- changing to/from grand staff overrides TscoreNote ambitus - there is no problem as long as ambitus is unused
- revert to native style under MacOs when Qt5

TO CONSIDER:
- In wizard: option for single note mode for very beginners
- In audio in settings: option for average pitch of whole note (aka voice/guitar mode)

==== SMALL NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS =============================================================
- average effectiveness line in chart
- add some Nootka-ish button instead of radio to TpitchView and button to switch intonation accuracy
- proxy corner widgets may be animated
- tidy key signature in note pixmap (width depends on accidentals number)
- text only tool bar
- shrink a bit score and note name in single mode
- Class that manages recent exams menu list and has colored item 'recent opened exams',
    use recent exams list for analyzer the same as start exam dialog has (common class or method)
- add blinking of settings icon(action) instead of expert check boxes in old versions
- move status label out as a separate class and implement animations there (can be used in settings windows as well) 
- make exam summary pretty
- certificates would have some additional data about melodies
- Tsound has to have a timer to determine rhythmical value of detected note (or a rest)
  then emitting signal should contain Tchunk instead Tnote
TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required

===============================================================
========== TRANSLATIONS =======================================
===============================================================
 - Entries of Accidental settings in creator were moved from Question Settings - find end confirm
 - TtoolBar has many entries translated already - just confirm them
 - Tpage_3 context was moved and description fixed but source text remained the same - just confirm
 - 'You are exercising on level' and 'Exam started on level' moved to Tcanvas from executor - just confirm
 
 
===============================================================     
============== Packaging (cpack) =============================
===============================================================
- update Qt5 dependencies for deb package 
- remember about libPrintSupport
