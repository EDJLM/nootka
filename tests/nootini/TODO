Nootini TODO list

- WAV headers are implemented in simple way only
- add 'stop' button to terminate processing
- some operation are allowed during processing but they should not (opening new file, starting new pass)
- x axis scaling (xSc) may depend on pitch range (frames per chunk) to make x axis the same
- there are many code from analyzer - make library of it
